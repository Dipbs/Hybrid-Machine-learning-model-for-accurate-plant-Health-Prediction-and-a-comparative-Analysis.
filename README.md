# Hybrid-Machine-learning-model-for-accurate-plant-Health-Prediction-and-a-comparative-Analysis.
This project delivers an all-compassing study on predicting plant health
status based on different variants of machine learning models, like Random
Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression. The potential effec-
tiveness of those individual models in terms of classifying the health status for
the features being key and derived from environmental and biological factors is
to be evaluated. We also present here a hybrid approach using a Voting Classi-
fier that improves the predictive performance through very strong combination
of individual classifiers. Models are used based on accuracy and precision met-
rics showing significant improvements in predictive capabilities when using the
hybrid approach. Our results suggest that the integration of several machine
learning approach interventions could lend to more accurate measures of plant
health, an important gain for agriculture management and sustainability.
